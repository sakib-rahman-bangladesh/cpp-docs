# `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` directives (C/C++)

The **`#ifdef`** and **`#ifndef`** preprocessor directives have the same effect as the [`#if`](hash-if-hash-elif-hash-else-and-hash-endif-directives-c-cpp.md) directive when it's used with the **`defined`** operator.

## Syntax

> **`#ifdef`** *`identifier`*\
> **`#ifndef`** *`identifier`*

These directives are equivalent to:

> **`#if defined`** *`identifier`*\
> **`#if !defined`** *`identifier`*

## Remarks

You can use the **`#ifdef`** and **`#ifndef`** directives anywhere `#if` can be used. The **`#ifdef`** *`identifier`* statement is equivalent to `#if 1` when *`identifier`* has been defined. It's equivalent to `#if 0` when *`identifier`* hasn't been defined, or has been undefined by the **`#undef`** directive. These directives check only for the presence or absence of identifiers defined with `#define`, not for identifiers declared in the C or C++ source code.

These directives are provided only for compatibility with previous versions of the language. The **`defined(`** *`identifier`* **`)`** constant expression used with the `#if` directive is preferred.

The **`#ifndef`** directive checks for the opposite of the condition checked by **`#ifdef`**. If the identifier hasn't been defined, or if its definition has been removed with `#undef`, the condition is true (nonzero). Otherwise, the condition is false (0).

**Microsoft Specific**

The *identifier* can be passed from the command line using the [`/D`](../build/reference/d-preprocessor-definitions.md) option. Up to 30 macros can be specified with `/D`.

The **`#ifdef`** directive is useful for checking whether a definition exists, because a definition can be passed from the command line. For example:

```cpp
// ifdef_ifndef.CPP
// compile with: /Dtest /c
#ifndef test
#define final
#endif
```
