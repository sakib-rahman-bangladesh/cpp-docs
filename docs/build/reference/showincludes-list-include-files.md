# `/showIncludes` (List include files)

Causes the compiler to output a list of the include files. The option also displays nested include files, that is, the files included by the files that you include.

## Syntax

> **`/showIncludes`**

## Remarks

When the compiler comes to an include file during compilation, a message is output, as in this example:

```cmd
Note: including file: d:\MyDir\include\stdio.h
```

Nested include files are indicated by an indentation, one space for each level of nesting, as in this example:

```cmd
Note: including file: d:\temp\1.h
Note: including file:  d:\temp\2.h
```

In this case, *`2.h`* was included from within *`1.h`*, causing the indentation.

The **`/showIncludes`** option emits to `stderr`, not `stdout`.

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Set C++ compiler and build properties in Visual Studio](../working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Advanced** property page.

1. Modify the **Show Includes** property.

### To set this compiler option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.ShowIncludes%2A>.
