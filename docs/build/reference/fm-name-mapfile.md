# /Fm (Name Mapfile)

Tells the linker to produce a mapfile containing a list of segments in the order in which they appear in the corresponding .exe file or DLL.

## Syntax

```
/Fmpathname
```

## Remarks

By default, the map file is given the base name of the corresponding C or C++ source file with a *`.MAP`* extension.

Specifying **/Fm** has the same effect as if you had specified the [/MAP (Generate Mapfile)](map-generate-mapfile.md) linker option.

If you specify [/c (Compile Without Linking)](c-compile-without-linking.md) to suppress linking, **/Fm** has no effect.

Global symbols in a map file usually have one or more leading underscores. It's because the compiler adds a leading underscore to variable names. Many global symbols that appear in the map file are used internally by the compiler and the standard libraries.

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Set C++ compiler and build properties in Visual Studio](../working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Command Line** property page.

1. Enter the compiler option in the **Additional Options** box.

### To set this compiler option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.AdditionalOptions%2A>.
