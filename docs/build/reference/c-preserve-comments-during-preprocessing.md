# /C (Preserve Comments During Preprocessing)

Preserves comments during preprocessing.

## Syntax

```
/C
```

## Remarks

This compiler option requires the **/E**, **/P**, or **/EP** option.

The following code sample will display the source code comment.

```cpp
// C_compiler_option.cpp
// compile with: /E /C /c
int i;   // a variable
```

This sample will produce the following output.

```
#line 1 "C_compiler_option.cpp"
int i;   // a variable
```
